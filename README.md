Since the beginning of 2023, I have quit all computing-related activities, marking the end of a hobby which had been a significant part of my life until then. This includes programming and anything set up here on my GitHub page. I've decided to move on with my life, make new friends, forge stronger bonds with old ones and explore new things (studying finance at university, playing in an orchestra, working at a hospital, trying out kendo and saving up money to travel somewhere). No new features, updates or maintenance will be performed on any of the projects I (used to) maintain. Thank you for all your support and understanding.

I used to be sad that it was over, but now I'm happy it happened. 

â€” Adrian
